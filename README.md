### Project goals

The Houses of the Oireachtas regularly hosts events and exhibitions, and also offers the public an opportunity to visit Leinster House for a tour of the historic building. The Oireachtas Events site seeks to provide a single booking system for tickets to all Oireachtas events and tours.  

The site will offer users information on all Oireachtas events, exhibitions and open tours, an ability to create an account to book, reschedule and cancel tickets, and important visit information. The site will allow the site owner to manage ticketing for all events through one site.  

## User Experience Design

### User Requirements and Expectations

### Agile Planning

This project was developed using agile methodologies by delivering features in sprints. There were 3 sprints in total, the work was carried out over four weeks.

Initially user stories were developed, and a full set of acceptance criteria was created in order to define the functionality of the required feature, these user stories were assigned to epics, prioritised under the labels, ‘Must have’, ‘Should have’, and ‘Could have’. Then they were assigned to sprints and story pointed, according to complexity. "Must have" stories were completed first, "should haves" and then finally "could haves". It was done this way to ensure that all core requirements were completed first to give the project a complete feel, with the nice to have features being added should there be capacity.

In GitHub projects, a Kanban board was used to track the progress of the project, the workflow started with To do then In Progress, Done and finally Closed, were the item was marked as closed.
