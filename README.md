### Project goals

The Houses of the Oireachtas regularly hosts events and exhibitions, and also offers the public an opportunity to visit Leinster House for a tour of the historic building. The Oireachtas Events site seeks to provide a single booking system for tickets to all Oireachtas events and tours.  

The site will offer users information on all Oireachtas events, exhibitions and open tours, an ability to create an account to book, reschedule and cancel tickets, and important visit information. The site will allow the site owner to manage ticketing for all events through one site.
